9 is a Kaprekar number since 
9 ^ 2 = 81 and 8 + 1 = 9

297 is also Kaprekar number since 
`297 ^ 2 = 88209` and `88 + 209 = 297`

In short, for a Kaprekar number k with n-digits, if you square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits, the resultant sum is k. 
Find if a given number is a Kaprekar number.

Write a function in kaprekar.rb

```
def kaprekar?(number)
  #TODO implementation here
end
```

Also create kaprekar_spec.rb, and write rspec to test this code.
